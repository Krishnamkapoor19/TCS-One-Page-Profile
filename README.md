## What this one-pager captures

### 1. Revenue growth trajectory

Over the five-year period (FY21–FY25), TCS revenues increased from ₹1.64 lakh crore to ₹2.55 lakh crore.  
Growth peaked in FY22–FY23 (17–18%) and moderated to mid-single digits (6–7%) in FY24–FY25.

This reflects normalization of growth at scale rather than a decline in underlying business performance.

### 2. Margin profile and operating stability

Operating margins remain stable across the period:
- EBITDA margins in the 26–28% range  
- EBIT margins around 24–26%  
- Net profit margins near 19–20%  

Despite growth moderation, profitability has been resilient, indicating cost discipline and pricing stability.

### 3. Capital efficiency metrics

Return metrics show steady improvement:
- ROE increases from 38% (FY21) to 51% (FY24–FY25)  
- ROCE rises from 47.6% to 65.3% over the same period  

This combination of moderate growth with rising returns signals increasing capital efficiency and strong earnings conversion relative to capital employed.

---

### 4. Valuation multiple context

Valuation multiples compress over time:
- P/E declines from 36x (FY21) to ~27x (FY25)  
- EV/EBITDA reduces from ~26x to ~19x  
- EV/Sales trends down from ~7.2x to ~5.1x  

This highlights multiple normalization despite improving return metrics, separating market re-rating from business fundamentals.

---

### 5. Dividend and capital return behavior

Dividend per share varies materially year to year, ranging from ₹38 to ₹126.  
This variability suggests opportunistic capital returns rather than a rigid payout policy, supported by sustained profitability and balance-sheet strength.

---

### 6. Ownership and balance-sheet snapshot

Promoter holding remains high at ~71.7%, with institutional participation from LIC, ETFs, and mutual funds.  
The capital structure section presents market capitalization, net cash adjustments, and enterprise value for valuation context.

---

### 7. Recent operational updates

The profile highlights:
- AI-led integration across services and internal operations  
- Revenue momentum supported by BFSI and North America  
- Selective workforce rationalisation aimed at efficiency realignment  

These developments are positioned as operational adjustments rather than indicators of structural stress.
